Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Nice to have you here. I'm a .NET Software Developer. I code in C#, C, C++ atm (family of C's, right?ðŸ˜„)
I do Mobile devs, Desktop apps and look forward to breaking into the Embedded systems world.

I have many other valuable skills asides programming. These include:
Computer Repairs, 
Graphic Designing, 
Affiliate marketing, 
Excellent Word Processors Usage (I've been a coach)
among others.

I so much love the feeling of competing in typing (cuz I type at 80WPM atm). 
I am a Christian. You a Christian?.
