Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Nice to have you here. 

I'm a dotnet Software Engineer. I have developed enterprise applications, mobile, web and desktop applications in my few years of experience.

I have other valuable skills aside from programming:
IT Support (Computer Hardware and Software),
I possess a decade of experience in Computer Engineering,
Excellent Word Processors Usage (I've been a trainer)
among others.

I love to beat the keys until something happens. Sounds and feels great.
