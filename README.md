Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Nice to have you here. 

I'm a .NET Developer (C# Major). I do Mobile devs, Desktop apps, Cloud and look forward to joining the Microsoft team to work on the AR/VR Tech.

I have many other valuable skills asides programming. These include:
IT Support,
Computer Repairs, 
Graphic Design,
